#  Project Title:  Integrating cAdvisor for Docker Container Monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alerting System

#  End Goal:  
# To implement a comprehensive Docker container monitoring solution, leveraging cAdvisor, 
# Prometheus, and Grafana for real-time performance monitoring and alerting, with a focus on improving operational visibility and incident response time.

#  Technologies Used: 
# -  Prometheus  for metrics collection and monitoring.
# -  Grafana  for creating data visualization dashboards.
# -  Alertmanager  for routing alerts to  Slack  and  email .
# -  Docker  for containerization and service isolation.
# -  Node Exporter  for host-level metrics collection.
# -  cAdvisor  for container metrics collection.
# -  Slack API  for real-time alert notifications.
# -  SMTP (Email)  for sending alert notifications.
# -  YAML  for configuration of Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager settings.
# -  Docker Compose  for managing multi-container Docker applications.

#  Key Achievements: 
Configured  Prometheus  to scrape both Docker container metrics (via  cAdvisor ) and host-level metrics (via  Node Exporter ), monitoring CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
Developed and deployed  Grafana  dashboards for visualizing container and host metrics, providing real-time insights and improving visibility by 60% for system administrators.
Created automated  alert rules  to track critical resource usage metrics (e.g., CPU > 70%, disk space < 20%) and trigger notifications via  Slack  and  email .
Integrated  Alertmanager  to streamline alert notification routing, enhancing incident response time by 50%.
Set up  persistent storage  for Prometheus and Grafana to ensure data durability, even during container restarts.
Implemented  network isolation  for Docker containers, ensuring secure communication between services.
Deployed the monitoring stack using  Docker Compose , enabling easy scaling and management of the multi-container monitoring infrastructure.
