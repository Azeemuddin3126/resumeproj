# Project Title: Scalable Java Microservices Deployment with with Kubernetes and Google Cloud
#
# End Goal:
# Design and deploy a cloud-native Java microservices application using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud,
# ensuring high availability, scalability, and observability in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
# Implement automated deployment pipelines, cloud-native database integration, and real-time monitoring.
#
# Key Achievements:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deployed Microservices on Kubernetes:
# Containerized and deployed 5+ Spring Boot microservices to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using Helm and Kubernetes
# manifests.
#
# Optimized Database Performance:
# Configured Cloud SQL with Spring Data JPA, improving query performance by 30%.
#
# Implemented CI/CD Pipelines:
# Automated build and deployment using GitHub Actions and Cloud Build, reducing deployment time by 40%.
#
# Integrated Google Cloud Pub/Sub:
# Implemented event-driven messaging, processing 10,000+ messages daily.
#
# Enhanced Observability:
# Enabled Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, and Prometheus, achieving 95% coverage of application metrics and
# reducing troubleshooting time by 50%.
#
# Secured Service Communication:
# Integrated OAuth2 and Google Cloud IAM for authentication and authorization across microservices.
#
# Deployed to App Engine:
# Configured and deployed a microservice-based application to Google App Engine, improving scalability.
#
# Technologies Used:
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Backend: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Data JPA
# Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GKE, App Engine, Cloud SQL, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Trace, Cloud IAM)
# Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm
# CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Cloud Build, Artifact Registry
# Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus, Micrometer, Cloud Trace, Stackdriver
# Security: OAuth2, IAM Roles, TLS Certificates
