# Project Title: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement with SonarQube, Dynamic Tagging, Slack, and Email Integration  
# Integration of SonarQube, Docker Tagging, and Notifications in CI/CD Pipeline

# End Goal:  
# Enhanced an existing Jenkins pipeline by integrating SonarQube for code quality analysis, 
# dynamic Docker image tagging for streamlined deployments, and Slack and email notifications for efficient communication.  

# Key Achievements:  
SonarQube Integration: Implemented static code quality analysis to ensure adherence to coding standards and identify vulnerabilities.  
Dynamic Docker Image Tagging: Automated tagging of Docker images using build numbers for consistent versioning and simplified rollbacks.  
Slack Integration: Configured Jenkins to send real-time notifications about build and scan statuses to a dedicated Slack channel, 
improving team collaboration.  
Email Notifications: Automated email notifications with build logs and scan reports for comprehensive status updates and traceability.
