# Migrating a Monolithic Website to Microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine

# This project involves migrating a monolithic application to a microservices
# architecture using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to improve scalability,
# resilience, and deployment efficiency.

# Key Achievements:
# - Deployed a 3-node GKE cluster and containerized the monolithic application
#   using Docker.
# - Broke down the monolith into three microservices (Orders, Products, Frontend)
#   using Spring Boot & Spring Cloud.
# - Automated CI/CD pipeline with Google Cloud Build, reducing deployment time
#   by 30%.
# - Implemented Kubernetes Deployments & Services, improving fault tolerance and
#   scalability.
# - Exposed microservices via Load Balancers, ensuring external accessibility with
#   minimal downtime.
# - Optimized API communication by configuring Ingress & Service Mesh, reducing
#   response time by 40%.

# Technologies Used:
# - Kubernetes (GKE), Docker, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
# - Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloud Build, Artifact Registry
# - React.js, Node.js (for frontend services)
# - CI/CD Pipelines, Kubernetes Ingress, Load Balancer
# - gcloud CLI, kubectl, REST APIs
