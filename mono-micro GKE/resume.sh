### **Project Title:** Migrating a Monolithic Website to Microservices on Google Kubernetes Engine

# End Goal:
# Successfully migrated a monolithic application to a microservices architecture using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
# to enhance scalability, resilience, and deployment efficiency while reducing downtime and improving system performance.

### **Key Achievements:**
Deployed a highly available GKE cluster: Provisioned a 3-node Kubernetes cluster and containerized the monolithic application using Docker.
Refactored monolith into microservices: Split the application into Orders, Products, and Frontend microservices using Spring Boot & Spring Cloud, ensuring modularity and scalability.
Automated CI/CD pipeline: Implemented Google Cloud Build and Artifact Registry, reducing deployment time by 30% through automated builds and rollouts.
Improved fault tolerance and scaling: Configured Kubernetes Deployments & Services, enabling zero-downtime updates and automatic recovery.
Optimized service discovery & API communication: Integrated Kubernetes Ingress & Service Mesh, reducing API response time by 40%.
Ensured external accessibility: Deployed Cloud Load Balancers, providing a seamless experience with minimal downtime.
Modernized frontend services: Developed and deployed a React.js & Node.js-based frontend for improved performance and scalability.

### **Technologies Used:**
# - Containerization & Orchestration: Kubernetes (GKE), Docker
# - Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, REST APIs
# - Frontend: React.js, Node.js
# - Cloud & DevOps: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloud Build, Artifact Registry
# - Networking & Load Balancing: Kubernetes Ingress, Cloud Load Balancer, Service Mesh
# - CI/CD & Automation: Cloud Build, gcloud CLI, kubectl

# This version keeps it structured, quantified, and ATS-friendly while emphasizing impact and modernization.
# Let me know if you need any refinements! ðŸš€
