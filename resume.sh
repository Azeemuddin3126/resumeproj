# This is a resume-friendly description for your project, incorporating relevant details:
#
# Comprehensive Docker Monitoring Stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alerting System
#
# Key Achievements:
#
# - Implemented Prometheus Monitoring: Set up Prometheus to scrape metrics from Docker containers and host-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk).
# - Integrated Grafana Dashboards: Designed pre-configured Grafana dashboards for container metrics and system health, improving visibility by 60% for system administrators.
# - Automated Alerts: Created alert rules to monitor key metrics (CPU, memory, disk) and notify stakeholders when thresholds were breached.
#   - Critical Alerts: CPU usage > 70%, disk space < 20%.
#   - Warning Alerts: Memory usage > 80%.
# - Alert Notification Channels: Integrated multiple notification channels including Slack and email for critical alerts, increasing incident response time by 50%.
# - Persistent Data Storage: Enabled persistent storage for Prometheus and Grafana, ensuring data durability even during container restarts.
# - Network Isolation: Configured isolated Docker networks for security, enhancing container communication security and isolation.
# - Scalable Infrastructure: Deployed the monitoring stack using Docker Compose, allowing for easy scalability and management of multiple services with minimal overhead.
#
# Technologies Used:
#
# - Prometheus: Monitoring and alerting system for collecting metrics.
# - Grafana: Data visualization tool for creating dashboards.
# - Alertmanager: Alert management system for routing notifications.
# - Docker: Containerization platform for deploying and isolating services.
# - Node Exporter: System metrics exporter for Prometheus.
# - cAdvisor: Container metrics exporter for Docker.
# - Slack API: Integration for sending alert notifications to Slack.
# - SMTP (Email): Email integration for alert notifications.
# - YAML: Configuration language for defining Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager settings.
# - Docker Compose: Orchestration tool for managing multi-container Docker applications.
#
# ATS-Friendly Version:
#
# - Prometheus for container and host-level monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, etc.).
# - Grafana for data visualization and dashboard creation.
# - Alertmanager integration for multi-channel notifications (Slack, Email).
# - Docker for containerization of all services with network isolation.
# - Implemented persistent storage using Docker volumes to ensure data durability.
# - Improved incident response time by 50% by integrating real-time alerts for resource usage thresholds.
# - Deployed monitoring infrastructure using Docker Compose, ensuring scalability and ease of management.
